# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while retaining as much information (variance) as possible. It transforms the data into a new set of variables called **principal components**, which are uncorrelated and capture the most variance in the data.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling the data to zero mean and unit variance.
- **PCA Implementation**: Using Scikit-learn to apply PCA on a dataset.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while maintaining key information.
- **Results**: Visualizing the transformed data and analyzing the explained variance.

## Requirements

- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas` (optional)

You can install the PCA with:

```bash
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
